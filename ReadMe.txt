StackedOverFlag

This is a game where the user has to match the question with the correct country. The user starts with 3 lives and 3 hints. Each wrong answer costs a life and each hint costs a hint. Getting 3 questions correct earns the user a hint. 

This app is built with React Native and Node.js. The frontend is built with Expo from the IgniteRed template and the backend is built with Express. Questions are stored in a CSV file.

The setup guide is in the README.md file in the frontend/StackedOverFlag folder.

Reflection:
Although I had been using React Native for a while, I learnt a lot from getting this to run. First, I had to understand the Ignite Red template I'm using because this is probably my second time using it after someone recommended it to me at the end of my summer mobile development project. The app has room for improvement and I might continue working on it to add features such as offline functionality with limited questions, leaderboards, authentication, and better UI. It was nonetheless an interesting little project.
